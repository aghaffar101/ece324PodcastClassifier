hello
everyone
i'm here with
james
nestor author of the book breath
that is now in colombia actually that's
why we are doing this interview actually
because i have your book
in spanish
and this book has been like a blessing
for me because it has been teaching
reading
for a lot of years and some people
doesn't believe me you know even being
back up for the oxygen advantage but
your book is a eye-opener
for a lot of people so even patrick talk
about your book like the most important
text on reading book on breathing on the
last 20 years
so i'm very honored to be here with you
today so how this adventure begins in
your life because you came from the
free diving world right
with with your book and a lot of mouths
breathing there you know
and actually that's another question i
have
for a moment how you change your mind
about freediving with the new work
you are doing
but how this adventure begins
to bright breath
uh you know it was a number of things it
wasn't one thing in particular it was a
number of things that kept adding up in
my professional life and my personal
life
and once after several years of finding
these sort of anachronisms in
medical literature and
finding different things that didn't
really make sense to me on a personal
level with my own health
i started
investigating breathing much more deeply
than i had ever done before and so this
again is is a process that lasted for
years and years
and it was when i met free divers that
really
alerted me that there was something much
bigger and more powerful going on with
our breathing than i had
ever thought
these people are doing things that are
supposed to be medically and
scientifically impossible and yet
they're doing them every day and i
learned how to free dive as well and
you know so i i think
people are looking for you know what was
the one thing i woke up one day and said
i'm going to write a book about
breathing but uh i i wish it were that
easy but it's not the the tale of of
what really inspired me is much more
convoluted and complicated
and
well reading is kind of if you go to the
free diving it can be a little bit
complex and extreme
but actually breeding is something
everyone does
but not everyone look at his breeding
for healthy
um
matters
you know so
you in your book put very simple things
in the first part of your book like nose
breathing close your mouth
the word with
what why showing is important so
why people must
have
reading in mind when they think about
their health
i think that breathing is such a simple
thing it's so obvious that a lot of
people don't consider how powerful it
could be and so these little hacks i can
tell you how to breathe properly in
about 10 seconds right it's pretty easy
breathe through your nose breathe slowly
breathe light breathe deep there you go
that's all you need
you're good to go but i what i found as
a science journalist was
was unless you understood
why breathing this way was more
beneficial if you once you understood
how it affected your body where these
practices came from you don't appreciate
it and
so much of health nowadays is so overly
complicated nutrition and diet now is
more complicated than it ever been
exercise is more complicated that sleep
is getting more complicated these things
don't have to be
overly complicated i think humans modern
humans have done a good job of of
convoluting a very simple message but
nature works in a very simple way so if
you follow nature as the guide for
breathing follow what any other animal
in the wild is doing
then that's your guide that's that's how
you should breathe but it's fascinating
once you start going out in the field
talking to researchers of how few of us
in the modern world actually follow
these
these guidelines by nature we don't eat
in a natural way we don't sleep in a
natural way we don't breathe in a
natural way and it's this is the main
reason why so many of us are so
diseased and it's a little bit sad that
we need to teach people how to read
actually because it's something that
born with you
and actually our work with the oxygen
advantage and you and i think
every breeding instructor in the world
is to empower the person of his own
health
in some in some
degree
so
uh
but the the person of today need to
understand with facts and that's what
you did
you put everything together
right because breeding was like all over
the place and you put it all together
and
this these findings how change
the way you look your own health when
you look breathing
in the whole spectrum
i think that
you know as someone who is coming in
from the outside it's allowed me
to just be curious about everything and
to talk with everybody so i had no
objective starting this book i still
don't have an objective i don't consider
myself an evangelist for one way of
breathing or the other that's not my
role here i'm just a reporter so i my
job is to go out and to try to honestly
report on what i've found
and and really without having any skin
in the game on one side of the argument
or the other so
in some ways that's an advantage because
you you don't know anything and you
accumulate facts and you talk to people
and you develop your own story in other
ways it's a complete nightmare because
you have to learn about biochemistry you
have to learn about respiratory
physiology you have to learn about all
these things that are really complicated
and take a long time in order to
truly understand so that you can convey
them back to an audience in a very
simple way
so this book took a very long time uh
it was a it was a complete nightmare but
at the end of it what i tried to do
is to express clearly and honestly
what i had found in this multi-year path
researching this stuff i'm sure other
people can write other books they might
come to other conclusions that's all
great this is this is the best i can do
and and that is what it is
but you know i work with i don't know
doctors and
um
a lot of professionals
in the health field
and sometimes this information is new
for them
yeah even when there has been a lot of
years
studying in the university so
why
professionals
in the health in the health in the
doctors hospitals they don't know this
it's so basic it's not a new era of
breeding this in the in the books in the
research for years and years ago so
why is that
this has been absolutely surreal for me
in the past year half of
the conferences and sessions and people
i've been talking to
are medical professionals
and
some of them at
very top institutions top tier in
research institutions and at one place
which i won't name they said this stuff
sounds crazy like where did you find
this stuff where did you research this i
said well actually this was researched
at your institution right down the hall
from you and the science is there it's
just so few people have the time and
capacity
or curiosity maybe to really look into
it
so
there are doctors in my family there are
pulmonologists in my family they had
never heard of the vast majority of the
stuff i was bringing up
and they're pretty pissed off about it
at the end of the day uh because it is
so basic and it can help people in in
such profound ways it's free it's simple
and yet
you're trained in a certain school in a
certain school of thought
to just address
chronic issues with a powder or a pill
which
those things work they absolutely
bronchodilators work oral steroids work
are they a good long-term durable
solution to every problem they are not
you know so i think that
the problem is
multi-factorial it has to do with
doctors just not having the capacity
you're seeing 10 patients an hour 15
patients how are you going to sit them
down and tell them how to breathe
properly impossible
um and it and it has to do with other
influences on the current medical system
as well i don't want to get too
conspiracy theorists but uh the one
thing i've heard from so many doctors
and researchers
at
top level institutions harvard stanford
yale
is that there's no money in breathing
let's be honest and so there's not a lot
of incentive to develop different
breathing courses to to help people um
and let's let's also be honest that
a lot of people do want a powder and
they do on a pill and those things
absolutely work i'm more interested in
the people who
want to try to use their natural body to
heal themselves uh if people just want
to tune out
use current medical interventions that
have potentially harmful side effects
but do address the acute problem that is
their free will to do that
um so
this book was was trying to express
this divergence in thinking and to offer
some context
on how to go about things in a different
way that have been scientifically
validated to work for several chronic
conditions
great and that was like the foundation
so i want to go to the basics
i mean
nose breathing
because i know at the beginning you
didn't want it to be part of the book so
deeply
but then you started you become the
the rats right you you experience this
in your body and the first thing you did
was plug your nose and this for me as a
breeding instructor is insane
but how was that experience without with
anders olsen
and
why you think someone that breathed
through his mouth cannot have
a good health
well
plugging your nose for 10 days sounds
insane and it is insane it seems like a
stunt i get that
that was never the intention of that
experiment if you look at
the
tens of millions of people hundreds of
millions of people who contend with
chronic sinusitis rhinitis inflamed
turbinates who have deviated septums who
have allergies who have chronically
stuffed noses
they're breathing through their mouths
all the time right so what we were doing
was just lulling ourselves into a
position that so much of the population
already knew
the difference was we were measuring
what happened to it um what happened to
our bodies what happened to our brains
what happened to so many different
systems
within us so i i realize and that's why
i didn't want to do the experiment i
said i don't want to do some super size
me thing that just seems like some jokey
jackass stunt where i'm like breathing
through my nose for 10 days uh the the
point was
to
is a no one else was gonna do this
experiment we tried uh and and and b i
wanted to personally experience what so
many people i had talked to
had suffered from which was what happens
when you're just breathing through your
mouth and another thing is
this experiment didn't prove
anything that was not the intention what
we were doing was just showing and
personally experiencing
what decades and decades of science has
been telling us over and over and over
again that the pathway through which you
breathe air profoundly affects your
health and i certainly felt that i'll
never do it again um don't suggest that
anyone else do it and if anything i i'm
hoping it was a big warning a big
caution to people
if you're obstructed you have to find a
way of clearing your nose period you
will never be healthy as a mouth
breather
so it's not the same because i mean
i'm now preparing myself for a free
diving um
contest i don't know if that's a word
but
here in my city we don't have
specifically
uh free diving
teachers you know trainers
and for them mode breeding is
very very
it's like you need to breathe through
your mouth even out of the of the pool
right
so
it's not the same breathing through your
nose don't breathing through your mouth
actually patrick said
what
how many functions your mouth do for
your breathing
nothing it's just in emergencies you can
you can you need to use it
so it's insane to say someone that is
the same to breathe through your nose
breathe through your mouth
while what happened inside the nose that
is so important for our for our health
oh so many things happen inside the nose
and and patrick's such a great teacher
and explainer of this stuff
you know we're humidifying the air we're
pressurizing it we're conditioning it we
get more oxygen we get more nitric oxide
um we're slowing down the air so that
our lungs have more time to extract more
oxygen we get about 20 percent more
oxygen bringing through our nose than we
do equivalent breaths to the mouth you
think that's not going to make a
difference in your life you're crazy
so
this is all known stuff too this is this
has been around for decades and decades
you know 100 years ago 120 years ago
researchers were talking about nasal
breathing the benefits of nasal
breathing they were doing scientific
studies into nasal breathing so so you
know as a reporter my job isn't to
actually do the research i did that one
experiment just as a conduit into the
subject so i could bring readers into
what it what it feels like and what it
looks like to breathe through your mouth
but i am just a filter
i find information
i find science i review data sheets i
talked to experts in the field to put
together the story so
you know what patrick is saying
shouldn't be revolutionary uh and yet
you mention it to people and people say
huh never thought about that i've been
breathing through my mouth my entire
life and i'm certainly one of those
people right
it wasn't until i was researching this
book that i said oh my god i've been
breathing through my mouth every single
night i know that because i wake up with
a dry mouth have this huge glass of
water next to my bed
and i breathe through my mouth during
exercise all the time and once you
realize this you say why hasn't someone
told me this
you know when i was a kid uh my face
would have looked different we know that
um so i would have been breathing better
as an adult it affects your skeleton
sure it affects your musculature it
affects your airways it affects your
brain function um if you have trouble
breathing during sleep it can affect how
tall you grow uh it affects whether or
not you get diabetes i mean i could go
on and on and on and again these aren't
my hypotheses this is this is standard
science so
it's these simple things that are right
in front of our face just like our nose
right in front of our face that
people get so blown away by but they're
like i had no idea and yet it's been
there the whole time
um and and so it was fun to research
that and realize that we've been missing
out on this such a wondrous way of
bringing air into our bodies and out of
our bodies through through the nose and
all the benefits that that has
and the impact in the cardio facial
growth
in the kids i think it's very important
to say this to parents to teachers
because this is a problem that develop
can can be worse
if a child before his 13 years read
through his mouth
can have an impact a profound impact in
his
in his
and in this area in generations
if we change the way our kids breathe
because i mean right now 10 of the
population have adhd
that's insane
and our kids
and our kids has growing and parents
doesn't know that
and it's so simple so simple why it's
important for a kid to breathe through
his nose and asses uh breathing when
they are growing
well i think that you touched on this a
bit is how you hold your mouth how you
hold your tongue is going to influence
how your face develops
so if throughout your early stages of
development you're like this
and you swallow like this
that upper palate isn't going to develop
wide enough and it's not going to spread
out okay it's going to move up instead
of spreading out which is going to make
your mouth smaller which is going to
make you more apt to have crooked teeth
when you're older which is going to
inhibit the full
development and the full potential of
your airways too smaller mouth smaller
airways that upper palate moving up is
going to occlude the sinus passages too
makes it harder to breathe through the
nose so what do you do
you breathe through the mouth
so you see this all the time you know
some estimates have said that
35 to 50 percent of kids are habitual
mouth breathers if you get kids with
adenoid problems inflamed adenoids or
tonsils
that percentage goes way up and what you
said about adhd and adhd like symptoms
of behavioral problems bedwetting
neurological issues growth issues
digestional issues like all of these
different issues
so many of them can be tied back to
sleep disorder breathing and i was so
aghast when i started talking to leaders
in the field started reviewing the work
of christian kimono down at stanford who
is considered the the godfather of sleep
medicine been stunning this stuff for 50
years he's been writing about this for
decades and decades and the fact that
kids who have these issues are are just
immediately given medications to keep
them up in the day and to let them go to
sleep at night is
is i think such a gross injustice
uh to them it really is it's it's like
if
those issues
persist
then i believe my personal opinion the
first thing you should do is look at
breathing patterns and especially
breathing during sleep if the kid is
suffering from snoring or sleep apnea
there's a good chance they're going to
have issues down down the road and that
needs to be addressed immediately
and again this this is not controversial
stuff people who study this have been
trying to get this message out for a
long time
who is it getting out to i this is the
first time i ever heard about it was a
few years ago which is which is crazy
but i think awareness is is really
growing now and that's what it's all
about yeah i i mean
and the nose when a kid breathed through
his nose
i mean if we
um achieve
that these generations of kids read to
their noses i mean this can be the the
basis
knows
this functional breeding
is the foundation of a lot of chronic
chronic issues
so do you think if we do a good job
as as you and all the instructors around
the world
to
spread the word up around about breeding
we can have a new generation of people
that
can enjoy themselves more
that they doesn't have to suffer of
anxiety and maybe be happier and don't
fight against life all the time
i would love to have that outlook on on
the world today i don't i don't quite
have it uh but but maybe i will maybe i
can change my mind
i i think a good parallel is to look at
how quickly our mouths shrunk how
quickly our breathing went to hell how
quickly our teeth grew crooked and it's
been shown in a single generation
teeth can grow and crooked mouths can
get too small respiratory problems can
develop because respiratory problems can
often be a a result of a mouth that's
too small for its face because you have
a smaller airway right and that upper
palate moves up so within a single
generation we can ruin our teeth ruin
our mouths
um in a large part ruin our breathing
which means in a single generation too
you can likely improve on this or or fix
it and
patrick has wrote something which i
thought was so fascinating in in his
book he said that about 40 to 50
of our facial development is epigenetic
so it is determined by environmental
input so genetics plays a big part right
but
the other half
is how you hold your mouth what foods
you chew
um what what other inputs you put in to
develop your facial structure and you
can see this from twins some of whom
were breastfed versus those who
fed and i'm not pointing fingers at
anyone for breastfeeding or bottle
feeding just want to be really gotten
into a lot of trouble with that before
but um i'm just giving you information
here or or kids who were given soft
foods early on or or weaned on to hard
foods or kids who had braces and didn't
have braces and look at the vast changes
in their profile
and the vast changes that occur within
their faces even within twins
so
to me this makes perfect sense right uh
that you want to start with a good
foundation you start with something
solid early on and it's so much easier
to build upon that instead of having to
go back and fix what was broken which is
why pediatric dentistry and orthodontics
is going to be mark my words this is
going to be huge because these experts
and researchers look at kids at six
months old they look at kids at a year
old they said this kid's going to be a
snorer this kid is having trouble
breathing let's fix it now and then they
when they develop and grow older their
mouths are big enough so their teeth
come in straight you know so uh i think
with technologies
that we have now and with awareness that
we have now we can fix a lot of these
problems that we've uh afflicted with
ourselves
to ourselves i should say in the last
200 300 years people have a hard time
believing that that our ancestors all
had straight teeth they had wide airways
they had wide noses
90 of us have crooked teeth what's going
on here if we broke it we can fix it
yeah there's this evolution that you
mentioned in your book and doesn't make
any sense and another
part of the puzzle is breathing less
is something that i called
the breeding paradox
breathe less
to oxygenate more and at the beginning i
mean i start with this four years ago
and
for people was like i don't get it
even when i explain about the carbon
dioxide the importance
how
breathing
really works inside of us
it's not just getting air inside your
body it's a complex mechanism so how you
explain someone
that doesn't get it
why it's important to breathe less
well that's your job as a breathing
therapist to explain that to people i
have the easy job of just writing books
and going away so
you're having to having to field all
these questions
uh the only explanation i would have is
you know when when you tell people that
they say you're crate this is some new
age crystal thing you're you're insane
and then you say
like check out the work of christian
boar 120 years ago check out the
work of yandel henderson 100 years ago
80 years ago you know check out the work
of buteyko we we've known this for so
long this is
basic biochemistry
of how oxygen
from red blood cells and gets into
hungry cells in our body
and yet people still don't get it
because we think
in the modern world that more is more
more is always better right i i i'm out
of breath i need to breathe more
but once you start to understand the
biochemical aspects of this and then you
understand the biomechanical aspects of
it you realize that it's it's not making
any sense it's like
having a car at a stop sign every stop
sign just revving your motor over and
over and over are you going any faster
doing that way are you running any more
efficiently doing that way no you're not
because when you breathe too much i
can't believe i'm telling you this
you're here the actually you know what
happens
when you know too much you tend to
breathe
up into the upper lobes okay
and you tend to just take air into your
throat into your mouth and to your
bronchi but they don't enter the lungs
that in the lungs are the things that
participate in gas exchange and the
lower lungs are much more efficient than
the upper lungs so duh of course you're
going to be getting less oxygen and
you're going to be working too hard to
get less when you're
and you especially feel this and see
this when you're exercising it's the
hardest thing to convince someone when
they're exercising they need to breathe
less to get more oxygen i'm sure you
have to deal with this every day um but
but it's true and look at a pulse
oximeter look at you know science from
100 years ago when you see how true it
is
well i hope in a couple of years people
get it easily you know
but let's see what happened i mean
maybe it's better that they don't get it
because now i have a job for that so
it'll keep you employed yeah exactly but
don't get it people keep over breathing
there you go
thank you
well and how these
um
all this knowledge
change the way you train for freediving
because and personally in freediving
right now i'm pretty new in the field i
just started practicing three weeks ago
this is a crazy stuff i will do like
going to this competition
but
how
you introduce
what you learn researching for breath
your book
to free diving
because there is a lot of
mouth-breathing there
there's there's a lot of mouth breathing
there but what people don't get it's
it's like when people say well when hoff
breathes through his mouth wim hof
hyperventilates people don't see the
other 23 and a half hours of the day
when wim hof isn't on stage he's humming
he's breathing through his nose he's
very breathing very slowly
very lightly in a chill way that's not
very fun to watch someone breathe like
that here i'll do it for five minutes
we'll see how fun that is to watch me
see not very fun uh i i stopped that
early because nobody nobody wants to see
that so it's the same thing with free
divers and i know a lot of free divers
have spent a lot of time in that
community
yeah you're breathing through your mouth
for those few breaths right
before you go and dive these people are
so
in tune with their breathing the rest of
the time
they're breathing very slowly very
calmly through their noses there's a lot
of humming going on but everyone just
sees that
and
to be clear we're talking a lot about
mouth breathing
and all the bad things and yes
chronic mouth breathing is a problem
okay i tried to make this clear in the
book i'm still getting hundreds of
emails of people saying i took two mouth
breaths today i'm worried i'm gonna get
cancer so
so i'm talking about chronic mouth
breathing so when you're laughing
when you're sighing
before taking a big dive even when
you're doing some pranayama or kundalini
techniques if you're doing wim hof
method you want to breathe through your
mouth go for it no one's judging you
when you're done with that go back to
nasal breathing at night when you're
sleeping nasal breathe the whole way
through no reason to mouth breathe at
all so with with free diving i was
always one of those hyperventilators
before i did a big dive uh i would just
breathe as much as i possibly could and
go under and you realize later that that
is dangerous because what you're doing
is offloading
too much co2 and your oxygen levels can
actually get very low to a dangerous
level but you weren't sensing the need
to breathe because your co2 levels have
been too low this is a little
complicated but for freedivers they know
this so it's much better in freediving
you can take these big enriching breasts
but they should be calm and fluid and
mellow and you should relax yourself and
you're getting into competitions that's
your prerogative go for it i much prefer
the other side of free diving where when
my body tells me it's time to breathe
i'm gonna go to the surface and go up
and get a breath of air and come back
down and enjoy this activity as a
meditation that's the kind of free
diving i'm into but whatever floats
people's boats is cool by me
yeah and you're right i mean
nose breathing is not a religion
right because can become that and it's
not about about it it's understanding
what is going on
in your body when you breathe through
your nose when you breathe through your
mouth and then you can decide when you
go
and breathe through your mouth like when
you will take the first
to go down in water
so we have to
make that clear and i know you make it
very clear in the book
but a lot of people
um
is going that extreme
never breathe through your mouth
and that doesn't make any sense no it's
not about that
it it doesn't but but this is just to me
it's a great analogy of how extreme our
cultures are it the people have to be
either zero or one hundred percent
people learn about some new breathing
techniques and they stop everything and
no that should be done very lightly you
should acclimate your body very slowly
right it's the same thing with diet
people hear someone on a podcast talking
about a new diet they stop their diet
immediately and switch over i guess that
keeps the economy running it keeps
america open for business and that's
that's fine but but uh don't approach
breathing this way i i really think that
breathing especially if you've been
breathing dysfunctionally for a long
time very gently and gradually get into
it and i would have the same advice for
freediving we're talking a lot about
freediving some people on a single
weekend say i'm gonna go down to 200
feet within three days
go for it if that's if that's what you
want to do you might get seriously hurt
but
for me free diving was much more
pleasurable to go down five feet for a
few seconds go down 10 feet for a few
seconds go down 20 feet before you know
it you're down at 70 or 80 feet and you
feel very relaxed it's this very gradual
thing it takes your body a long time to
acclimate to things so so i would not
push it with with any of these exercises
good advice actually i'm doing it just
for
the challenge for doing it but i don't
want to be an expert free diver
and
well i want to know
how you met patrick mckeon
because i know you have a couple of
lines in your book
but now you are like very close and you
talk a lot and you call him for
conversations how
you met each other
was after the book how was that
no i um so i had read his sort of later
in the game about halfway three quarters
of the way through my research i found
all of his books and read them i said
wow this guy's really on it and i liked
his story so i reached out to him and i
said hey do you want to do i have a few
questions and i was very clear i said
i'm a journalist as well i'm writing a
book about breathing
i i've seen some of your research and
it's the same research that i found we
had a great conversation and at the end
of the conversation
i probably shouldn't say this but he he
said he's like you know a lot of people
call me up and they just steal
everything i tell them and they don't
give me any credit and i said i promise
you i'm not one of those people i'm
gonna give you
folk anything that that i'm taking from
someone else's work i'm going to credit
and i'm going to acknowledge them and i
do that in the book we i had a much
longer conversation with him
specifically about
mouth breathing and exercise and all of
that got cut the book was um
285 000 words uh the current book you
have is about 90 000. so a lot of stuff
had got got left on the cutting room
floor
so after that conversation you know i
gave him an early copy of the book i
said this is this is my view of this
this stuff how it came into it he really
liked it and um then we just kept
talking uh you know i really think that
it benefits everyone by working together
uh you know i don't know if patrick
agrees with a hundred percent of what
i've said i don't know if i agree with a
hundred percent of absolutely everything
he says that's not the point that the
point is he's done the work he's done
the research he's an expert in the field
he's experienced this personally he's
helped treat thousands and thousands of
people and i think the vast majority of
what he says he's light years ahead of
of everyone else so it's been a real
privilege to get to
get to know him and to swap different
scientific studies and continue on with
this conversation
and what i love about patrick is he
opened the door for
a lot of people
to understand the science behind behind
reading and start teaching it like me
and i think right now it's not about
um
why you believe
or
um
having a guru
it's not about that is how you
understand reading and how you can help
others
to empower themselves
and i think the most important part of
the oxygen advantage and the boutique
clinic that he have is putting all these
persons together all this family
together
and
in the oxygen advantage what patrick
said i like the oxygen advantage because
it's not
um
based on any kind of
belief or guru
i just take the science
i put it together and i put this method
together so you can use it and help
people and of course we are always open
to this and others we don't fight with
we have we don't fight with other
methods you can use the oxygen advantage
to complement what you do
and i think if if we all go together as
one
know like you are this method you are
this other method and we fight each
other and i don't like that but if
everyone just have
the
fundamental knowledge about reading
you know like the first part of your
book read through you know to your nose
really slowly you know all these kind of
things that are almost universal you
cannot harm anyone with this
the worst thing that can happen is that
this person can improve his health
so what do you think is the future of
breeding
do you think people will
open more to this
i hope so and what i've seen in this
community is it it is a lot more open
and supportive it's not like everyone is
constantly trying to defend their ground
or
ripping on other people because you
don't get anywhere doing that uh it's
been a real privilege to get to know wim
hof i've spoken with him a few times and
again he's someone do i agree with a
hundred percent of every single thing
he's ever said no does he agree with but
but the foundation were both have the
the same mission is to try to
disseminate this information to people
to to help people empower their own
health right anders olsen as well such
an amazing guy done such amazing work
and it's it's just so great to be able
to know these people and and to feel
that there isn't this underlying
competition like someone's always trying
to steal something from someone else it
really feels supportive because and i
think everybody wins when you're able to
come together in that way
so much of the world now is so divisive
that people are just looking for issues
that they can uh ridicule someone over
and and no one wins when you do that
so again it's not about uh agreeing or
worshiping one method or the other it's
about considering these things and
acknowledging that science is not a
closed book it's not a closed door it's
constantly changing i know that
patrick's views on hyperventilation
training have changed a bit in the last
few years in my views on
hypoventilation training on breath hold
restriction has have really changed in
the past few years too we're honest
about this things develop i'd be very
worried about someone who's been saying
the same thing in the scientific
community for 30 years because we've
learned a lot since then and you have to
progress and keep up on the latest
research if you're really going to be
able to have the full breadth of
knowledge on a subject
actually in his new book he have a
little a little bit of hyperventilation
so
he's open i mean there you go there you
go that's
pretty cool and
you have a book it's called get high
without drugs
yeah so
hold on get high now
without drugs everybody exactly and i'm
going to tell you
amazing you're bringing this up i'm
gonna tell you a story about this
um
i this was i wrote that book uh 11 years
ago um
right
the full yeah uh it was through
chronicle books my my uncle was this
this
playboy who lived in the hollywood hills
successful businessman orange corvette
pant suits
um the whole deal and he passed away and
i was going through
all the records in his house he was a
big hippie
um you know really into meditation and i
found all these crazy notes and methods
of of meditation and different ways of
altering your consciousness and as as a
joke i pitched this book to chronicle
books i was very hard up for money at
this time and i like the book the book
combines humor and science and different
ways of using your natural body to to
alter your consciousness and and to
benefit your health
the editor and the publisher gave it
that name and i've just never been able
to live that down i hated it when they
mention it i said no i'm not going to
write a book no no but they they were
the ones with the uh paycheck and and
they insisted this was the right title
they were wrong uh however the content
of that book uh
i i think is uh
some people might find of interest i i
tried to
approach these things in an accessible
way make it fun but also to have real
science behind it so that's what that
book is i will give it a chance and it's
very interesting for me because here in
colombia we work with of course with
fusion and breeding but i work with
meditation with my family
all my family are pulmonary actually my
nickname is the respirators
the name was before your book okay
for the book
yeah
i didn't steal that i mean i swear i
would have given you credit had i
you you must do
okay and we work
with breeding but we work with
meditation and with ayahuasca and plants
and we are mixing both together how you
can
lead or
teach someone to breathe
so they can go through the experience
more relaxed and having more
power
in their nervous system because
sometimes the bad experiences with these
plants is because the peop the person
just panic
it's a new experience and they panic and
they just everything becomes hell
so we
here in my house we have this shaman
that come
and we
bring together breed work
and plants and of course meditation
and the experience has been beautiful
with people with mental issues
addictions
and another kind of emotional things or
physical things
and i think i saw that book
yearbook
and maybe
it's like yeah you can get high without
drugs of course but plants
and asian plants
you can get high with drugs is what
you're saying
yeah
okay
because i mean plants are not rocks but
plants is like when you do holotropic
breeding
you know sometimes you need to push hard
if you want to
to transcend
something inside you so the plants
ayahuasca peyote
well lsd is more chemical but you know
what i mean and this mixed
with someone that work with his breeding
can be a very very deep experience and
can help
a lot of people
so have you tried any time
any of these plants
i have not
joe rogan really really put me on the
roads on the ropes with that when i was
talking to him i i have never done
ayahuasca um it's interesting i was
talking with roland griffiths at johns
hopkins university one of the top
research institutions here in the us
who's been doing a lot of work with
mushrooms and i think he's uh in in
incredible work and finding it's more
effective than any other therapy and
just this morning dr alyssa epple at
university of california san francisco
she just invited me to
attend a psychedelics conference where
it's psychiatrists psychologists um and
other people in academia who are
studying this stuff in a real way and i
think it's so exciting um when it's done
under the right terms in the right way
and that that's where i i think it is
very uh important i mean if you think
about people who have serious mental
health issues with ptsd you have other
issues the amount of options that are
given to them amount of drugs uh they're
just numbing this this problem and they
work
kind of well for doing that ssris really
don't work any better than with the vast
majority of people unless you have
serious depression but these drugs seem
to do something to the brain they seem
to reboot the brain in in a very real
and beneficial way when they're done
under controlled and proper
circumstances so to me it makes perfect
sense that you could incorporate breath
work in with these other rituals and
plant medicines to elicit a positive
response um and it sounds like you do
this responsibly it sounds like it's in
a very controlled environment and uh and
what a wonderful thing
it is and you know i used to work with
people with a very deep issues mental
issues
addictions
uh even agoraphobia
and with breeding you can help them a
lot and because
but sometimes in some points
this thing is the push they need to go
through the thing
and going outside the plants and
ayahuasca and all this stuff because i
use i have
a lot of experiences i'm sorry my
english is not perfect and maybe
sometimes it's great
thank you better than my spanish so okay
good that's good and i used to live with
indigenous people here in colombia and i
had a lot of research around this how
they do things
and now looking how they
breathe even
because if you go to very deep
communities
the shape of the faces are insane
it's beautiful to see
but
going outside that water maybe we can
have that conversation sometime
um but
you taught at the end of your book about
breeding plus
and you talk about hyperventilation
and in the oxygen advantage we have the
high altitude training
you know it's breath holding without the
hyperventilation
and a breath hold after the exhalation
so
you break
the
the balance
of your body the
chemical balance of your body
and you force the body to do adaptations
and i have my sister she have lupus
let me actually
show you my sister now
but
we did the high altitude training and in
some point the inflammation start to
diminish
so
i think there is we need a lot of
research around all these things
but
i think if you do and do breath holds
after the exhalation
and you have a hyper can hipper coupling
response an epoxy response and you can
influence
the
the
[Music]
immune
response of your body and that's pretty
amazing that you can do that
just by breathing and i had used the
high altitude training with persons with
agoraphobia and they wanted they was
sick of taking medication
so
we use this technique and they
in two weeks they told me it's insane i
feel
that i'm taking medication but i'm not
taking medication
and i think it's because the carbon
dioxide
so
i know there is a lot of things we need
to understand
around reading
but i think we are going to the right
path and this book your of you
that you wrote
is
an open door for a lot of people to
understand the power of this
so
i don't know
do you think
that
breeding
can be um i don't know important of the
next step for really treats
mental health some mental health issues
i think yeah without having my opinion
in here because i try not to have
opinions as a reporter but
i will
paraphrase what many psychologists
neuropsychologists psychiatrists have
mentioned to me is
they have found it to be
the single best intervention for panic
for other fear-based disorders and
there's currently thankfully more
research going into co2 therapies right
now
where they give people with panic other
anxieties agoraphobia even anorexia
depression
co2 they give them co2 because these
people have such a hard time holding
their breath
because they're acclimated to have very
low co2 in their bodies right because
they associate an increase of co2 with
an attack that's when they get this
constriction so they breathe like this
all the time
so it's hard to get them to hold their
breath so they give them co2
and a big bolus of co2
it's doing the same thing that you're
doing it's just using another technology
right and it helps to get them over that
hump so that they can then start
incorporating breath holding techniques
and be more comfortable with it it's
like it wakes their body up to um starts
to acclimate them to having more co2
being comfortable with with that in
their bloodstreams for their
chemoreceptors to be more flexible
so
there has been co2 research for over 100
years i included some of it in the book
i had to cut out about 20 to 30 pages i
really did a deep dive into this stuff
spent several months in in it
and it has according to these
top level researchers it is the most
effective therapy out there
for
anxiety for panic and more and
it was extremely popular 80 years ago
being studied at top institutions and
then it just went away
so that's why i kept finding the same
pattern which is why the new science of
a loss start it we keep losing it and
finding it losing and finding it losing
and finding it and it's it's crazy so it
seems like we're on this upswing right
now with co2 research which is really
exciting but
what you're doing by altitude training
by breath holding at the end of exhales
that's co2 training
you know it's like the same from inside
it just has a different you're using
your natural body it has a different
name so we know it's effective i hope
that there's going to be a lot more
studies into this i'm still in contact
with dr justin feinstein who's a real
leader in this field and he's so excited
to get back in the lab once covid washes
over us and and to continue doing this
research
yeah the justin work and the part of the
co2 was very interesting for me because
maybe we don't understand fear
right
so
i mean we think we know everything and
maybe we don't know anything
how co2 levels the chemoreceptors from
the brain
are
connected with fear
and maybe how we can help these people
because i mean some people with panic
attacks anxiety they go to the
psychologist
right because they think it's something
emotional
that
maybe psychologists need these kind of
tools and maybe they can help more
people if they understand the
foundations of this us well
psychologists have been using
cabinometers for for 50 years for 60
years um so
they've been in on this uh robert fried
in the 1960s and 1970s
he's at
cooney hunter school uh in new york has
been talking about he wrote four books
about this stuff so again it's it's not
new um and and i i agree it's it's i
learned this stuff from psychologists
right that that's who told me about this
and it's
very interesting to see so many of them
reinvigorated with this research and and
all of them um starting to get very
excited about doing new studies because
it's so obvious the science has been
there for a long the measurements have
been there
um it just people need further
convincing i guess in order to get it
paid for from insurance which is really
the name of the game here in the u.s
and
you know hearing in these countries
sometimes we are five years
back of you in the states and everything
and what i'm trying to change that
because as you said
you learned this from psychologists so
but the but majority of the population
maybe don't know this
so what i want to do with this interview
with you and my work with the oxygen
advantage and other experts is to bring
faster the information
about breeding to the spanish market
so we can help more people
and empower more professionals and
giving these tools for them to help more
so
i think we can go to questions and
answers
i mean i i'm new in this platform it's
called stream stream io and i don't know
what the comments are but my brother is
helping me
i don't know this is my first time on
this as well i just press record so i
hope everyone's seen in here okay
now i have hit i have them here
in my in my my are we streaming on
instagram or is this live i have no idea
this is live it's live in youtube and
it's live in facebook
wow okay hi hi everybody hi everybody
okay i think that
people think africa i'm just talking
into a screen right now i have no idea
where this stream is going but but now i
do
so uh i was a little confused about that
i wouldn't have cussed so much uh had i
known but too bad you're gonna have to
deal with some curse words everybody
i'm sorry
i'm watching the email
sorry about that now we are going live
okay
good
so
sean
he's one instructor for the oxygen
advantage
uh
this is not introduced in school he took
outside the schooling to be introduced
to the dynamics of the breath yeah
um
[Music]
okay
sean flood was my eye-opening doorway
into the phenomenal potential with the
breath and the patreon can really show
the science of the blood chemistry of
how health is harnessed
boom
thank you sean
okay
uh
i don't see a lot of comments but i want
to find the questions
okay
i have one from anastasia zaniz he's
from greece one of our instructors thank
you anastasis for joining us
who other reading teachers does james
consider it is worth following and
studying under a side patrick
i don't want to name names um i i think
that so many teachers uh can offer so
many benefits find the one that that you
respond to the best patrick's got a
really wide berth on his view on
breathing so that's a good place anders
olsen's great
uh i like whim wim has more of a
singular approach to to his breathing
and and what he likes to do
but i mean find someone that that you
respond to that that you're getting uh
good results from and and stick with
that so that's a long way of just
fudging an answer there i have no
specific names to offer you
okay
james can you explain mouth breathing in
we hope method just your opinion thanks
sure yeah it's great yeah if you're
going to breathe through your mouth for
20 minutes a day and you're going to
hyperventilate that's fine to do it on
wim hof method i find there's a lot more
benefits nasal breathing during wim hof
method um i i much prefer to nasal
breathe but do whatever works again this
is 20 minutes a day this is i'm not
saying go and mouth breathe for 24 hours
a day it's 20 minutes a day
if it's easier for you to mouth breathe
do it if you want to challenge yourself
a little bit and breathe through your
nose
do that if you want to breathe a little
slower and not get as high from
breathing you can breathe through your
nose i much prefer
nasal breathing sometimes in through the
nose
out through the mouth works but
i like inhales and exhales through the
nose when i'm doing these quote-unquote
hyperventilation techniques i just i
feel it so much more strongly and you
feel the diaphragmatic motion so much
more profoundly this way um but do what
works for you
i do it with my nose too but it doesn't
matter if you do it with your mouth it's
okay
do you know
from take a deep breath question for for
james do you know why we can flare our
nostrils and what is the benefit of this
why we can flare our nostrils
i would assume i'm now flaring my
nostrils right when you said that i
would assume that's to get more air in
at times of stress right
um and i'm not stressed now but i'm just
starting to do this this is now a
terrible habit i have i have not looked
into the
um the conscious control of nostril
flaring but i would assume it's that
that they have the ability to open up so
that we can get more air in through our
noses
good then i have a lot of highs hello
james and
sending a lot lots of love
and okay
hi james love your book where can i
learn more about the techniques created
by the woman who used brief work to
treat the scoliosis
er katrina's crotch
you can contact the sh shroff method
school which i believe is still in
austria it was in greece for a time but
now it's in austria johns hopkins
university is also still
teaching the shroff method there are
various other instructors out as well
just know what she was doing it's no
more complicated
than stretching
and breathing what does this look like
when i do this
looks a lot like yoga to me i don't know
it would be crazy that that activity
that's been around for 5 000 years
that's what that seems like to me but
this is an extreme version i actually
knew somebody i'd still know her uh that
used this for her own scoliosis it's
much more intense because troth was
german of course it needs to be more
intense and so a lot of like stretching
contorting their body breathing into
this lung breathing out of that lung
that kind of thing but i can't tell you
exactly how to do it but the school
certainly could
and it's insane how
lungs give shape to the body
so
we have to think about the
non-respiratory functions
of your respiration you know your
breathing muscles
right
if you're there's an old shiny i think
it's
1700 years old that says
if the form is perfect the breath is
perfect too
so of course your posture is going to
dictate how you're able to breathe
belisa vranich has done some amazing
work in posturing the biomechanics of
breathing and we lose about 30 percent
of our capacity to breathe when we're
hunched over like this and she's also
mentioned that we have 11 pounds of
respiratory muscles and these muscles
need to be fit and they need to be
stretched and they need to be worked out
just like any other muscle if they're
going to be able to work properly and so
much of us go through to our days like
this or looking at our phone and even if
we wanted to breathe healthy that way we
couldn't and and here's an example why
don't you just take a big enriching
breath through your nose
look what immediately happens to your
posture and your body when you do that
right you can't take that big enriching
breath and get those six liters of air
into your lung if you're if you're
hunched over like this it's it's
impossible so
both those things need to go together
and you'll look better if you're
breathing more more fully because your
posture will be up unless you think it
looks better to be like this which which
you'll look better if you are breathing
more poorly so um i'm not going to get
into body aesthetics but
our bodies if you look at nature as the
guy once again look at any other animal
look at how it's breathing i'm looking
at my dog she's sitting right over there
she's asleep and she's just breathing
into her belly and out right she is not
a mouth breather except when she's
thermoregulating then she'll
breathe like this the rest of the time
breathing that's our guide this is what
our ancestors did this is what all the
other mammals on the planet do we should
do it as well
and the connection in the lung with the
lung capacity capacity and longevity
is
wow
absolutely the quicker your long shrink
the quicker they become
diseased the harder it is to breathe the
quicker you're gonna die and that's what
the data has shown us and to me it makes
perfect sense we get most of our energy
through breath
we don't get most of our energy through
food or for drink as as a lot of people
think that's where you're getting no we
get most of our energy through the air
that we breathe that's not to say
you don't need food you don't need drink
in order to we need all these things but
most of it comes from our breath
so of course if you're struggling to do
anything
25 000 times a day
it's going to wear on your health and
the last thing you need when you're 70
or 80 years old is to struggle to
breathe so the good news is it's
reversible
all that shrinkage of the lungs for most
people it's reversible
and and when you reverse it you're able
to breathe more easily your body is able
to work more efficiently
that's what it's all about
great thank you so much for that okay
james recently cited a report about
health benefits of using breathing
device
has he tried this personally
breathing into bags
no breathing device a device breathing
breathing device sorry um
there are
dozens of breathing devices there's a
bunch that have come out in the last six
months um
some of them i think are effective
and some of them are great training
wheels to get you to where you want to
go i like anders olsen's uh relaxator
such a simple very small device
it just controls your breathing pattern
there are different apps there are
different gizmos
all these things depending on what
you're looking for can work i like the
technology that's inside my brain and my
lips and my lungs that's pretty good
technology
um
but you can use whatever
whatever you find is offering the most
benefit i i can't recommend anything
right now but i'm not gonna say that
these these devices are crappy and you
don't need to use them
everyone's different right use what
works
yeah i can say just start with your body
start exploding your body and after that
you can find out what works for you
start with your own technology okay
james can you describe your daily weekly
regular report practice
how has it evolved as you've grown in
your practice
yeah just 12 hours a day i'm focusing on
my breathing uh for four now i don't do
any of that so uh a lot of people think
that since i wrote this book i'm now
just you know wearing a robe and
and um and just sitting around my house
focusing on my breath but that that is
not my job
my job was to become a reporter and
interview some people that sit around in
robes and focus on their breath all day
that's my job so that's not to say i
didn't pick up some tricks right i
picked up a lot of tricks from patrick
from wim
from anders learned a lot from him and
yes i incorporate these things into my
day-to-day life but i am not a breathing
therapist i'm not the teacher you're
talking to a great teacher here
um and then that's what you do for a
living but but that isn't that isn't my
jam so to answer your question i want to
throw out that caveat i'm reading
through my nose all the time as often as
i as i possibly can does that mean 24
hours a day no it doesn't sometimes i
just took a breath through my mouth
right there that's fine um and i i try
to wake up in the morning and do some
vigorous breathing be that kundalini
breathing which i'm a huge fan of their
sudarshan kriya which i love sometimes
wim hof method before i go to sleep i
try to do some very slow
meditative breathing again sudarshan
kriya i think is a wonderful practice
but again that's just me everyone's
different so the foundation though of
breathing is the easy stuff and that's
the stuff you don't need to sit in the
corner to do cross-legged right breathe
through your nose breathe slowly
make sure you're not defaulting to mouth
breathing at night make sure you're
breathing through your nose this is
simple stuff anyone can do and everyone
can benefit from it
great thank you for that okay
um
the last one
okay in the book you mentioned alternate
nostril breathing and the impact on both
sides of the autonomic nervous system is
there any more you can tell us about
that
i thought i was pretty thorough i'll be
a little more thorough right now so
basically we've got these two different
channels right uh inhaling through the
right nostril stimulates the body
increases heart rate increases blood
flow
increases blood pressure it also tends
to stimulate
the left side the analytical
quote-unquote side of the brain more
left nostril has the opposite effect
calms you down lowers heart rate so
there's been studies on this stuff for
the last 20 years
um what i think is interesting is that
yogis have been practicing this for they
didn't have capnometers they didn't
weren't able to look at hrv or galvanic
skin response or they didn't have eegs
or ekgs or anything else
but they knew the effects that these
breathing practices were having which is
why they've been around for thousands of
years which is why when you go to a yoga
class now a lot of them start with they
call it alternate nostril breathing also
known as nadi shahana you know is is the
yoga term for it
so uh you know beyond that if you just
understand the i'm sure there's more
subtleties maybe there's there's
different things happening in in your
blood gases when you're breathing
through this um way i included these
studies on the website in the back of
the book and
anyone can choose to take a a deeper
dive
if
should they choose
one of the benefits is you breathe
lighter because you don't have enough
room you create more
more resistance to the breath and that's
how you
breathe lighter you breathe slower
there's more pressure
so um yeah and and that's but it is
interesting um the the hemodynamic
changes in the body and and the
neurological changes that that occur i'm
not sure that those are tied to just
breathing slower and lower otherwise
you'd be able to just breathe slower
through both of your nostrils like this
and have those same effects and and you
don't
so it's fascinating stuff and what's so
great about all this stuff is you can
measure it a lot of people at home with
wearables can measure what happens to
their blood sats what happens to their
heart rate what happens to their blood
pressure their hrv and more
by just changing your breathing so you
don't have to believe us
right
believe yourself believe the numbers on
these instruments that are showing you
how your body is changing
good and i promise that was the last one
but
here is a good one
there will be a breath part two
can you tell us a little bit about your
next projects or you just have our
clouds
if i was a smart business person uh yeah
maybe there would be but i am a terrible
business person
there will not be a breath part two
people uh it is not gonna happen i put
everything i could everything i knew
about breathing into this book and this
book is uh you know it's not perfect i
did the best i could so but i'm not
writing another i'll tell you that
i'm i'm moving on and uh i'm so excited
after having
had the pleasure and privilege of
talking about this book being on you
know podcasts and all that for the past
year and a few months that i leave next
week for two months
to start a new so i'm starting a a
literally a new new chapter in my life
of of research to start a new book
and i'm logging off
all electronic devices and i'm just
gonna go back to listening and learning
instead of talking so i'm really really
excited to to get back into
that mental space
and uh and to dig into another subject
that i'm really excited about
good we really want to know about that
and i'm not going to tell you what it is
okay that's the next question not going
to build the expectations but i know
you're not breathing
definitely not breathing okay i know you
have been working
on video series for breath how is that
going
when we will top secret stuff don't know
where you can heard that top secret so
yes i did my
research certainly did you got access to
my inbox
so
what i
i we we are in certain stages of
development on a possible
miniseries um that if this goes through
fingers crossed i'll have an excuse to
go travel the world for for a year
relive some of these experiences but
most importantly dig even deeper into
this research not just into breathing
but many different aspects so
i love writing books because i love
being alone i love being in my own head
i love
that process um
so i'm gonna try to balance these two
things if if the mini series happens
great but i have to be working on a book
in the background and moving forward in
some ways so that's what i'm doing for
the next two months uh and we'll see
what happens after that
i hope
this project just
makes a reality because a lot of people
don't read but a lot of people watch
videos
so yeah
yeah well we'll see uh you know it's a
it's very easy when well not very easy
but when you work on books you you've
got one boss it's you you've got one
employee it's you when things don't get
done you can blame someone it's you if
you control your universe you decide
what route who you're gonna interview i
really like that when you start working
with large groups of people you lose
that control and things can spin out of
control pretty easily so
you know i'm cognizant of that we'll see
what happens in the you know when it all
comes down to it though i am uh
i love writing books uh and that's
that's my thing and i will never stop
doing that hopefully this other thing
can complement that but but that's my
main thing we hope you never stop
yeah
thank you i really enjoy
to write your books
and okay finally i just want to thank
you
er
really your work has been
very important
for all of us
and for the breeding world
for a lot of people
so
has been a amazing tool for me to create
awareness and i'm very happy to have
your book now in spanish
and
i hope we
still in touch and let us know
what is next
and i hope to see you here in colombia
sometime maybe you can take ayahuasca
with me and my
family we'll see what happens thanks a
lot for having me
