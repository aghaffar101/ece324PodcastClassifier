People don't realize is about 25% to 50% of the population habitually breathe through their mouth. They don't realize the neurological problems that this causes, the respiratory problems, this causes problems with snoring, sleep apnea, even metabolic disorders. I mean, it goes on and on and on. So we knew that after years, it can change the structure of your face. It's so common in kids that it has a term called adenoid face.
If you see these kids with very long faces because they've been mouth breathing so long that their faces have actually the musculature and the skeleton have changed. It changes your skeleton? Yeah, it creates a longer face so that air that comes in through the nose is slowed down, it's filtered, it's humidified, and it's conditioned. So by the time it gets to your lungs, your lungs can absorb that oxygen so much easier. Even if you eat keto, vegan, Paleo, whatever, even if you exercise all the time, if you're not breathing right, you're never really going to be healthy.
